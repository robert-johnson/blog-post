## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Udacity Data Science Nanodegree assignment.  I have chosen to analyze the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. 

I will be looking into the following questions:

1. Does population impact the amount of vaccine distributed to each stateï¼Ÿ
2. Are states running out of vaccine, which is causing a slowing of the vaccination of the people?
3. Does population density impact the efficiency of the vaccination process? 

## Files Used<a name="files"></a>

The following files are used as the raw source for the vaccination data in the United States:
1. us-total-covid-vaccine-doses-distributed.csv
2. us-covid-19-total-people-vaccinated.csv
3. us-covid-number-fully-vaccinated.csv
4. us-population-2020.csv

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@u0509421/fifa-19-complete-player-dataset-what-can-we-tell-from-it-f7343fdad020)
